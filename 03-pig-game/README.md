# Pig Game 🎲

A simple and fun two-player dice game built with JavaScript as part of my JavaScript learning journey.

## 🎮 Game Rules

- The game has **2 players**, playing in turns.
- On a turn, a player can **roll the dice** as many times as they want.
- Each roll adds to the player's **current score**.
- If the player rolls a **1**, their current score is lost and the turn switches to the other player.
- A player can choose to **Hold**, which adds the current score to their total score.
- The first player to reach **100 points** wins the game.

## 🛠️ Built With

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- DOM Manipulation
- HTML5
- CSS3

## 📚 What I Learned

- Managing game state in JavaScript
- Working with events and event listeners
- Updating the UI dynamically using the DOM
- Writing clean and organized code
- Handling user interactions and game logic

## 🚀 How to Play

1. Click **Roll Dice** to roll the dice.
2. Keep rolling to increase your current score.
3. Click **Hold** to save your score and pass the turn.
4. Avoid rolling **1**!
5. First player to reach **100 points** wins 🎉
